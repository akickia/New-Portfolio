            Kicki Lindstand was one of my students in the course IT: Tech for Women at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola. From the first day of the course, it was obvious that Kicki had a passion for learning and coding. During the course she continuously asked thoughtful questions that demonstrated her desire for not only learning, but also understanding code and how everything worked together. She would often take initiative to find more advanced material online and implement these techniques into her projects as well as help other students when needed. Kicki was a delight to teach and her passion for programming was reflected in her well-coded projects. With each project it was apparent that she understood the material and her code became cleaner and more advanced with each assignment. I I wish Kicki the best of luck in the future and hope that our paths will cross again.
